# Ignore batch files

# Ignore files without extension
# (anything that doesn't contain a dot and isn't a directory)
# Negative lookahead for dot in filename
# Unfortunately, Git doesn't support regex in .gitignore, so we use this trick:
*          # ignore everything
!*/        # but keep folders
!*.?*      # keep files that have at least one dot in the name
!README.md # explicitly keep README (since it matches no dot rule)
!stock_update.py # explicitly keep your main script
!.gitignore
